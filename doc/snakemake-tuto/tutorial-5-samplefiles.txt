- Write rule which writes the letter "B" in the file "sample_B.txt"
Notice the redundancy in the code for creating sample_A and sample_B (file name, file content).
Find and read the wildcards section in the Snakemake manual
Write rule to create the file "sample_{any}.txt"
Use the rule to create the files "sample_C.txt" and "sample_D"
Modify the rule to write the {any} letter in the output file.

Modify the rule's recipe to write the very name of the rule and the output pattern ({any}) in the output file "sample_{any}.txt"
Use it to produce the file "sample_E.txt" with content: "Rule {rule}: EEEE"
