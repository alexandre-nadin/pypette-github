# Foreword
# ----------

The Snakemake official documentation is your best ressource and it will often be referred to in this tutorial. You can find it here: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. Instead of learning all the documentation content in a straighforward way, this tutorial actually aims at guiding you through practical examples. You will directly learn all the minimum basics that will be useful for writing pieces of our pipeline.

Requirements: Basic knowledge of the shell (bash), basic knowledge of python, smiling.


For this tutorial you can either install Snakemake on your local machine (I recommend installing it with conda) or log to the cluster and use the version available there.
