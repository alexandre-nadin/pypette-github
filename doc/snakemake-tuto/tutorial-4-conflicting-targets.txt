# Conflicting targets
# ---------------------
- Write a rule to create "sample_A.txt" from python shell (in a run block). As above, write the rule name and the letter 'A' in it.

- Execute the target. It should fail.

- Read the Snakemake error message: You have two rules that create the same target, Snakemake can't decide which one to execute.

- Read the section for dealing with ambiguous rules in the Snakemake manual.

- Set your rule order accordingly, giving priority to the latest rule.

- Execute the target, and check you have the new rule name printed in it. Else check your rule order again.

You can invert the rule order, reproduce the file and check it contains the first rule name inside.
