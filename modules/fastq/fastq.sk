# Wildcards Constraints
#
# Organization of the outputs follows a convention both in the naming of the 
# files as in their directories. As such, we define regex constraints on the rules' 
# wildcards. Those wildcards are defined outside of the rules, so they are 
# global to all the rules. Each constraint can then be overridden specifically 
# in the rule itself, the last declaration prevailing.

#
# Convention: 
#   - {preprocesses} should be present both in the input and output. Can be empty.
#   - {process} is only for outputs as it is about the process defined by the
